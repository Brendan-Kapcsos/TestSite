                <h1>JOHNS CREEK DESERVES <br>BETTER THAN BRADBERRY</h1>
                <p>
                    In just under four years as Mayor, John Bradberry has ushered in an unprecedented era
                    of dishonesty, recklessness, and embarrassment in Johns Creek.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mayor Bradberry inherited a well-run city that received national recognition for being
                    one of America’s best places to live – what has Johns Creek City Hall been known for
                    since he took over?

                <h1>LACK OF LEADERSHIP</h1>

                <p>Mayor Bradberry’s administration has divided our City Council and alienated our hard-working city
                    employees. Since taking office, Johns Creek has had a staggering 50% turnover in staff. 140 of the
                    City’s 284 employees have left under his watch – this includes 70 employees from Public Safety, 8
                    from Finance, plus 7 key roles including:
                    <br><br>
                    • City Manager &nbsp;&nbsp; • Assistant City Manager &nbsp;&nbsp; • Finance Director &nbsp;&nbsp; 
                    •Finance Manager &nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br>
                    • Human Resources Director &nbsp;&nbsp; • Economic Development Director &nbsp;&nbsp; • Community
                    Development Deputy Director
                    <br><br>
                    His latest project, the highly controversial $90 million Performing Arts Center project, has divided
                    City Council and residents alike. But Mayor Bradberry is committed to forcing this project through
                    by whatever means necessary, even as local leaders, city officials, and concerned residents continue
                    to voice their objections.
                    <br><br>
                    But Mayor Bradberry’s refusal to listen to homeowners doesn’t stop there – most recently, the Mayor
                    muscled through a widely unpopular project to rezone 204 acres of agricultural land in the Shakerag
                    district to allow the construction of a massive new subdivision. The proposal violates the city’s
                    Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The Planning Commission recommended that the proposal be rejected.
                    Residents loudly protested.
                    <b>Mayor Bradberry ignored them all.</b>
                </p>

                <br>
                <h1>LACK OF ETHICS</h1>

                <p>Mayor Bradberry is under investigation by the Georgia Ethics Commission for numerous violations. He
                    has consistently been late with campaign finance disclosures and has unduly reimbursed himself with
                    taxpayer funds.

                    <br><br>
                    These investigations are ongoing.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h1>LACK OF INTEGRITY</h1>

                <p>
                    Mayor Bradberry has continuously broken promises to residents and taxpayers.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>THE MAYOR SAYS:</b> Johns Creek is financially healthy and fiscally responsible
                    <br><br>
                    <b>THE TRUTH:</b> The City’s debt is growing at an alarming rate. We currently have a $16 million
                    loan balance. We have the $40 million Parks bond – the parks aren’t completed, the money is gone,
                    and we will be paying it off for the next 22 years. Additionally, the City has a $550 thousand dollar paving debt it has yet to pay off.
                    <br><br>
                    On top of all of that, the Mayor wants to force even more debt with the $90 million Performing Arts
                    Center. If approved, this would leave the city with nearly $150 million dollars of total debt. We don’t need it and we can’t afford it.
                    <br><br>
                    We’re already dealing with the consequences of this reckless spending - $5.2 million in critical
                    services and $6.5 million in capital projects have been cut. Residents are now paying stormwater
                    utility fees. But Mayor Bradberry sees fit to keep the spending spree going.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>THE MAYOR SAYS:</b> Public Safety is his top priority.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>THE TRUTH:</b> There have been $5.2 million worth of requests from Public Safety that have gone
                    unfunded. Money is being moved from the Public Safety budget to fund the Performing Arts Center.
                    <br><br>
                    This should come as no surprise – in the Mayor’s own words “The Performing Arts Center is my number
                    one priority. These other things, we add when and if we can.”
                    <br><br>
                    <b>The Performing Arts Center as a necessity, Public Safety “if we can.” What kind of priorities are
                        these, Mayor Bradberry?</b>

                    <p>“I want to stay focused on the Performing Arts Center and until we’ve got that issue adjudicated,
                        I
                        can’t, I’m not going to get distracted with other things.”</p>

                    <p>“We know that this is probably never going to break even.”</p>
